# VR-360-Immersive-Video-Play


This program allows an user to view famous places over the world with 360° immersive video as if the one is actually in the place
Created in Unity Ver 2019.2.18f1

To save github's storage, used gitignore = "Unity". And so there is no 'apk' file

Playable with Oculus Quest - **Open "360" Scene in "360Project" folder inside "Assets" = Assets -> 360Project -> 360 Scene**


Mainly used C# and Skybox assets

-- Buttons Manual --

"London" button goes back to video for London when the user is not watching London. 
There is only one the other place when clicking "Random" button.
"Restart" button restarts the 360 video from 0:00.
"Pause" button pauses the 360 video at current time.
"Start" button should be pressed after "Pause" and "Restart" to continue the video.
