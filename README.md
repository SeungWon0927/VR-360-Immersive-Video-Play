# VR-360-Immersive-Video-Play


This program allows an user to view famous places over the world with 360° immersive video as if the one is actually in the place
Created in Unity Ver 2019.2.18f1

To save github's storage, used gitignore = "Unity". And so there is no 'apk' file

Playable with Oculus Quest - **Open "360" Scene in "360Project" folder inside "Assets" = Assets -> 360Project -> 360 Scene**


Mainly used C# and Skybox assets

There are only one the other place when clicking 'random' button.

To watch how it works, go to my project web, "https://www.notion.so/purdueseungwon/Seung-Won-Kim-s-Works-42199ff8965741f19480821a4cd61d23", and check "VR 360° Immersive Video Play" section
